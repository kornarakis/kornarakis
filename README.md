### Hello world

I'm a passionate developer from Greece, living on the island of Crete, with over 18 years of experience in web development.
I'm currently working at [Phaistos Networks S.A.](https://github.com/phaistos-networks) as a Tech Lead / Deputy CTO.

### What I Do
- `Frontend`: Passionate about VueJS, along with HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript, and React. If you are looking for a huge fan of VueJS and PHP, you just found it.
- `Backend`: Proficient in PHP and MySQL, with experience in Node.js, MongoDB, Golang, and Firebase.
- `CI/CD`: Skilled in GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Jenkins.
- `Testing`: Experienced with Jest, Cypress, and Puppeteer.
- `DevOps`: Knowledgeable in Docker, Docker-Compose, and server management using cPanel, WHM, and WSL2.

### Experience
I have developed over 200 custom premium websites from the ground up, each featuring tailor made content management systems. My work encompasses both backend and frontend development, SEO optimization, and server configuration.

Additionally, I possess a strong background as a CG artist, with proficiency in design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Painter, and Flash, as well as 3D animation software including Blender, Maya, and ZBrush.

In my free time, Iâ€™m working on my electric ðŸŽ¸ guitar skills (apologies to my neighbors!).
