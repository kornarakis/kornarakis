### Hello world


my name is Nikos , I come from Greece and I live in the beautiful island of Crete.

I work as a web developer for the last 14 years and I am still passionate in learning what’s new in web technologies. 

I'm currently working at [Phaistos Networks S.A.](https://github.com/phaistos-networks) as a Lead Developer.

If you are looking a huge fan of ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/vue.png) **VueJS** and ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/codeigniter.png) **Codeigniter**, you just found it.

I've built more than 170 custom premium websites from scratch with custom CMS for every client, as a result of which I gained a lot of experience on backend development, frontend development, SEO optimization and servers configuration.

For my backend development I use ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/phpp.png) **PHP** and ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/mysql.png) **MySQL** mainly, but also I've worked with projects that need ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/nodejs.png) **nodejs** and ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/mongo.png) **mongodb**.

For my frontend development I use of course **HTML** with **PHP**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. For my CSS I use ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/sass.png) **SASS**.

Except from Vanilla Javascript, I use ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/vue.png) **VueJS** (that I really love) and ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/react.png) **React** (that I really love to hate). For the JS automations I use ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/webpack.png) **Webpack** and ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/gulp.png) **Gulp**.

The last thing I've learned and I am very excited about is ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/docker.png) **Docker** and docker-compose.

Currently I'm learning ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/angular.png) **Angular** and ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/ts.png) **Typescript**.

My favorite editor is ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/vs.png) **VSCode** (previously was SublimeText) with a ton of extensions to improve my workflow and day to day tasks.

My favorite OS ( after more than 12 years working with my friend ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/tux.png)Tux on ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/ubuntu.png) Ubuntu machines only), is ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/microsoft.png) **Windows** with **WSL2**. The perfect combination. Stable, fast, and with WSL2 you can run Ubuntu, Kali, Debian, Suse and Fedora at the same time ... magic.

For server management I've used ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/cp.png) **cPanel** with **WHM** mainly but also **Plesk**.

For my personal repos I'm using mainly ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kornarakis/kornarakis/master/img/bb.png) **Bitbucket**.

I've also have a strong background as a CGArtist with with experience on design apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, Painter and Flash. And experience in 3D Animation with Blender, Maya and zBrush.

On my free time I love taking my 🚴‍♂️ bike for a spin and playing with my electric  🎸guitar.
